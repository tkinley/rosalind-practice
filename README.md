 # rosalind-practice
- My Python solutions for Rosalind bioinformatics problems
+
+A collection of personal solutions to exercises from [Rosalind](https://rosalind.info), a site for practicing Python and bioinformatics skills.
+
+## Repository overview
+- **Purpose:** A set of solved problems from Rosalind covering Python basics and introductory bioinformatics tasks.
+- **License:** MIT (see `LICENSE`).

+
+### Bioinformatics Stronghold
+- Contains Jupyter notebooks solving bioinformatics problems such as counting nucleotides, GC content, complementing DNA, and transcription.
+- Each problem sits in its own folder with sample inputs.
+
+### python-village
+- Early foundational exercises in Python.
+- Each folder includes an input file and solution script or notebook.
+
+## Important things to know
+- Exercises are independent; there is no shared library.
+- Many solutions are notebooks, so run them with Jupyter.
+- No automated tests or CI; validation is manual.
+- Dependencies are minimal, mostly Python standard library.
+
+## Where to go next
+1. Open and run the notebooks to view the solutions.
+2. Add more Rosalind solutions using the same structure.
+3. Refactor common utilities into modules and add tests if expanding.
+4. Consider automating dataset downloads and validation.
+5. Learn the bioinformatics concepts behind each problem.
